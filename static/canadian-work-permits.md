# Canadian Work Permits.


Canada is actively seeking foreign workers and professionals to help grow its strong national workforce. Whether you are looking for permanent or temporary work in Canada, or even if you are a Canadian employer seeking to bring in skilled professionals from abroad, below you will find some valuable online resources to help accomplish your goals.


In most cases, in order to work in Canada, the foreign worker will need a work permit. However, there are a number of circumstances where you may be able to work in Canada without a work permit. In addition, there are number of other ways to work in Canada without undergoing the traditional work permit application process, including work permits granted for working holidays, post-graduate work permits or permits issued under NAFTA.
