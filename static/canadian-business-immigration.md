# What are your options for Canadian Business Immigration?


### If you are a business person or manager looking to immigrate to Canada, the Canadian federal and provincial governments offer a number of options that may allow you to fast-track the Canadian immigration process.

Through Canada's Business Class immigration programs, Canada aims to attract individuals that have a significant ability to contribute to the Canadian economy. These programs are offered with the goal of promoting economic development and bettering the job market by attracting investors, entrepreneurs, and self-employed professionals from outside of Canada with available venture capital, significant business acumen, and entrepreneurial skills

Business Class immigration also seeks to develop new commercial opportunities in Canada and to improve Canada's access to growing foreign markets by welcoming foreign nationals who are familiar with those markets and their unique requirements and customs


If this option sounds well-suited to your experience and goals, there are several immigration pathways from which to choose. For example, depending on where you plan to reside, you may choose to apply through the federal programs or under the programs offered by a particular province, such as the Quebec Business Immigration programs.
